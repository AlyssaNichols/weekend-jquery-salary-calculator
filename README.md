# jQuery Salary Calculator
Create an application that records employee salaries and adds salaries up to report monthly costs. 

## Description

- This application records employee salaries and adds up theh salaries to report monthly costs. 
- The input form collects Employee's first name, last name, ID number, job title, annual salary.
- The 'Submit' button collects the form information, stores the information to calculate monthly costs, and adds the information to the table below. It will also clear the input fields to input the next employees information.
- If the total monthly cost exceeds $20,000, the background color of the total monthly cost will turn red.
- When the employees information is added to the table it will also add a "Delete" button. The delete button removes an employee from the table and updates the total monthly cost amount. If removal of an employee brings the monthly total below $20,000 the background color of red will go away.
